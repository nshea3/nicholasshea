Experience
----------

**Applications Engineer, Modular Mining Systems**

Position held November 2017 to February 2019. I served as a technical contact for Modularâ€™s clients, including several oil supermajors. My responsibilities included administering client SQL Server databases and production reporting, and providing data-driven recommendations to our clients. I was also responsible for software troubleshooting, bug reporting, acceptance testing, software update projects, user training, and requirements gathering for new software features.


* SQL Server Admin and Reporting

* Bug Reporting and Acceptance Testing

* Requirements Gathering

* Linux Administration (RHEL)

**Teaching Assistant, DILAB (Design and Intelligence Lab), Georgia Institute of Technology**

I graded student assignments and assisted in preparation and presentation of course materials, including an interactive electronic text with code examples in Python. I assisted instructors in addressing student questions and troubleshooting technical problems.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
