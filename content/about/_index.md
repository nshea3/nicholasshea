## About me

I am a recent graduate of Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. I am currently employed at a software company in Tucson. I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2016 with an engineering degree.

I plan to use this blog as a record of my work and my ideas. My current interests include machine learning and data science, natural resource exploration (especially geophysical methods), geostatistics, GIS, and remote sensing.
