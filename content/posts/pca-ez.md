### Introduction

The Maximum Noise Fraction (MNF, Green et al., 1988) transform tries to split a multivariate signal into a factors that have an increasing signal-to-noise ratio. The model it underlies is that the covariance of a signal \\(Z\\), \\(\Sigma\\), can be decomposed into two independent covariance components, 

$$\Sigma = \Sigma_N + \Sigma_S.$$
